#### Statistical Modeling

Copyright 2014-2027 Ashish Dutt. Licensed under the MIT license.

The core objective of this repository is to help me learn statistical modeling in `python` programming language. Although, `R` programming language is the defacto standard for statistical programming. I think it will be good to know its implementation in python too.

The repo contains `data, code, resources and plots` folders, for statistical and machine learning.
